This repository has all the solutions for Problem 1,2,3, and 4 in JAVA 
I tried coming as close to following the instructions for the main files as possible, however, for some reason on Eclipse, I was not able to generate a file type separately for the main file of Problem 2

For Problem 1, I couldn't get the "main" code to call the functions properly though I implemented the user input codes
For Problem 4b, I did some independent research and realized that for the desired kind of output, the problem required the use of Set Type and thus I implemented it in the function to the best of my comprehension. However, I was getting errors in calling the problemFourb([1 2; 3 4],5) function in the given manner and so I changed format a little by creating a separate 2D "apple" array. However, I would end up getting a blank array as the output. Basically, I couldn't learn how to print the output for Set Type in functions.
